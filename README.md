MacDown is an open source Markdown editor for OS X, released under the MIT License. The author stole the idea from [Chen Luo](https://twitter.com/chenluois)’s [Mou](http://mouapp.com) so that people can [make crappy clones](https://twitter.com/remaerd/status/484914820408279040).

Visit the [project site](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) for more information, or download [MacDown.app.zip](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/download/latest/) directly from the [latest releases](https://github.com/MacDownApp/macdown/releases/latest) page.

## Development

### Requirements

If you wish to build MacDown yourself, you will need the following components/tools:

* OS X SDK (10.8 or later)
* Git
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io)

You may also need to install Xcode’s command line tools with the following command:

    xcode-select --install

> Note: Due to multiple upstream bugs, Xcode may fail to build certain dependencies if you use the CocoaPods with versions lower than 0.39. Please upgrade CocoaPods, or use Bundler to execute a local version (as suggested above) instead.

An appropriate SDK should be bundled with Xcode 5 or later versions.

### Environment Setup

After cloning the repository, run the following commands inside the repository root (directory containing this `README.md` file):

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    bundle install
    bundle exec pod install

and open `MacDown.xcworkspace` in Xcode. The first command initialises the dependency submodule(s) used in MacDown; the second one installs dependencies managed by CocoaPods.

Refer to the official guides of Git and CocoaPods if you need more instructions. If you run into build issues later on, try running the following commands to update dependencies:

    git submodule update
    bundle exec pod install
